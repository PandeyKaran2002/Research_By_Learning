# Research_By_Learning

# AIM
This website is developed as the official website for Research By Learning Hackathon organised by TechnoCultural Club of Gautam Buddha University.

# Structure of the Website
This static website is created with the idea in mind that content and requirements will increase.
It is compatible in every screen size - be it a laptop or a mobile phone.
In mobile-view, the navigation bar can be accessed by clicking the icons on the top-right part of the screen.
The present content is divided into rows and columns.

# Salient Features
Each content has a distinct colour scheme depicting distinct idea.
A navigation bar is included that takes you to the 'ABOUT US' AND 'CONTACT US' section of the site.
An extra option like 'Blog' is given in case there's a need in future.
Hovering over the menu options gives a transition. 
In fact, every content box has a hovering effect.
The Faculty Coordinators have the links to their LinkedIn profiles in their names.
One can also visit the TechnoCultural Club's official Instagram and LinkedIn pages by clicking the icons.
Overall, the theme of the website is minimalist and clutter-free, symbolising the event's core values.
